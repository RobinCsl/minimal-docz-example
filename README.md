# Minimal Docz.site Example

---

This was bootstrapped using the instructions on Docz's landing page. One additional step was needed:

```
yarn add -D docz-theme-default
```

You can run the development version with:
```
yarn docz:dev
```
and build the site to deploy it with:
```
yarn docz:build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder inside `.docz` which you can serve on Netlify or any other static site hosting service.
